## Notes

**If Eurofins is slow:**
- Push manufacturer for their COA
- Ask Eurofins for expedited
- Worst case: delay new SKU launch to Week 7-8, don't let it block everything else

**If ops hire takes longer:**
- Agencies can still onboard
- You run things for 2 more weeks
- Don't rush a bad hire

**If Amazon ungating is slow:**
- Agency should have playbook for this
- Supplements can take 2-4 weeks
- Start FBM while waiting for FBA approval

**If someone offers $2.5M+ while you're doing all this:**
- Take the call
- Weigh it against the upside of the growth plan
- Clean books + momentum = leverage

**Production run checklist (for future orders):**
- Confirm unit count and SKU mix
- Get production timeline in writing
- Request progress updates at 25%, 50%, 75%
- Confirm shipping method and ETA
- Coordinate 3PL receiving window
- Have Eurofins COA ready before units ship (for Amazon compliance)
- Don't pay final balance until QC samples approved
