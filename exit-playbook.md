## Listing Strategy

### Empire Flippers Listing (if you go with them)
- [ ] Complete application
- [ ] Provide P&L and supporting docs
- [ ] "Briefly tell us about your business" - use the copy we wrote
- [ ] "Describe the work you do" - use the copy we wrote
- [ ] Set asking price: $3M (or "open to offers above $2.5M")

### Positioning
**Strengths to highlight:**
- 70M+ organic views, creator-driven growth
- 35 creators with proven pipeline to scale
- 28% net margin, $660K TTM profit
- 5-10 hrs/week owner involvement (soon 2-3 hrs)
- Ops team in place (CS, creator manager, VAs)
- 3PL fulfillment, no warehouse
- New channels launching (Amazon, TikTok Shop)
- New SKU launching (Jan)
- $70K inventory on hand/incoming

**Objection handling:**
- "Why selling?" → Starting a new venture-backed company
- "Platform risk?" → Diversifying to Amazon + TikTok Shop
- "Creator dependency?" → 35 creators, no single creator >10% of revenue
- "Paid ads not working?" → Haven't needed them, creator model is profitable

If you get a $3M offer before all this is done, take it. If not, the business is worth more in 6 months.
