# Product Liability Insurance Guide for Supplements

## Why You Need It
- Required by most retailers (Amazon, Target, etc.)
- Protects against claims from product use (allergic reactions, adverse effects, etc.)
- Most buyers/acquirers will require it as part of due diligence
- Cost is minimal relative to risk exposure

## What It Should Cover
- **Product liability**: Claims arising from use of your product
- **Completed operations**: Coverage after product leaves your possession
- **Personal & advertising injury**: Covers marketing claims
- **General liability**: Slip/fall at events, etc.

## Recommended Coverage Limits
- **$1M per occurrence / $2M aggregate** - minimum for most purposes
- **$2M per occurrence / $5M aggregate** - better for Amazon, retail, and M&A
- Some retailers require specific limits (Amazon requires $1M minimum)
